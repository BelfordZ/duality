This is a mad old project that I found sitting on my old laptop and decided to commit it. 

This project was the beginnings of a webstore. Fully client side, single page, client side shopping carts, and a sessionless php server. I don't even think I used jquery back when I wrote this, its pretty horrible.

BUT I commited it... why?

because its hilarious, and for the time, kind of the right idea!
